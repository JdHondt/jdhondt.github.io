Hi there! I'm Jens, a Postdoctoral Scientist at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/). I recently graduated with a PhD from the Database group at the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science) at [TU Eindhoven](https://www.tue.nl/en/).

My research interests are twofold. Currently, I am working on super-resolution models for upscaling atmospheric simulations, with a focus on physics-based neural networks and ML-based simulation emulators.
Previously, my doctoral work focused on the design and implementation of efficient algorithms for multivariate similarity search, particularly in the context of high-dimensional data.
This involved detection of high-order relationships in large databases, as well as the design of efficient algorithms for similarity search on multivariate data.

Some recent projects I have been working on include:
- Super-resolution models for upscaling atmospheric simulations using physics-based neural networks and ML-based simulation emulators;
- Fast detection of high-order relationships in large databases ([Correlation Detective](https://correlationdetective.com/) library) [[1]](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p1266-papapetrou.pdf), [[2]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00778-023-00815-y), [[3]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10597715), [[4]](https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/199766579/d_Hondt_J..pdf);
- Efficient similarity search on multivariate data [[4]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14723);
- Large-scale evaluations of distance measures for multivariate data [[5]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10555114), [[6]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3725258);

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss any of my work. I am always open to new collaborations and opportunities.
