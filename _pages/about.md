Hi there! I'm Jens, a PhD candidate in the Databases group at the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science) at [TU Eindhoven](https://www.tue.nl/en/).
My research interests are in the area of scalable data analytics, with a focus on similarity search algorithms on large databases.
My recent work has focused on the design and implementation of efficient algorithms for extended nearest neighbor search, which involve detection of high-order relationships or search on multivariate data.

Some recent projects I have been working on include:
- Fast detection of high-order relationships in large databases ([Correlation Detective](https://correlationdetective.com/) library) [[1]](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p1266-papapetrou.pdf), [[2]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00778-023-00815-y), [[3]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10597715), [[4]](https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/199766579/d_Hondt_J..pdf);
- Efficient similarity search on multivariate data [submission under review];
- Large-scale evaluations of distance measures for multivariate data [[5]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10555114), [submission under review];

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss any of my work. I am always open to new collaborations and opportunities.
